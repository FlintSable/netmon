## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This is a start to a network monitoring terminal application.

Here's what works and doesn't:

- Menu is partially working
- Montoring is not working
- Creating a new instance of server is working

I need to continue working on this project as I was not able to get to the actual networking code because i'm stuck with the menu items.
